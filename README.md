## Introduction
This program is an implementation of the Runge-Kutta RK4 method and the Numerov method for solving the Schrodinger equation for a particle in a potential well to extract the wavefunction and allowed energy levels. It is part of Chapter 9 in the computational physics textbook by Landau(2015)[^1] on numerical ordinary differential eqautions.
